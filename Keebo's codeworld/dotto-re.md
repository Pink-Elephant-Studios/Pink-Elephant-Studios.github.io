Bandits break the windows, shove through the door.

The staff are evacuated, rapidly, by [Hellen](Chef Hellen.md) <!-- note: you dispatch one of the bandits if you manage to fix the file name into something less likely to cause errors. also note: html comments work in markdown--> who puts them in floating boats moored out the back, along with those patrons who don't stay to fight.

An owl flies in through one of the broken windows, and attacks another Bandit, while Cathryn, the parrot with a robot suit, battles two of the rogues at the front door. 

If you want to help the owl, today you will be building a [random-quote-machine](https://freshman.tech/random-quote-machine/)

For every step you complete (players can take turns), you defeat another bandit.

If you want to try to run away, then you can get a [focus app](https://github.com/ayoisaiah/focus) (the the same designer) to work.

-[learn javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)

-[look at js libraries](https://hackr.io/blog/top-javascript-libraries)  

-explore [wordpress](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/)

The first character to approach you is a shady-looking man named "Scout." He offers to give you a healing potion in exchange for information.

-[look at js libraries](https://hackr.io/blog/top-javascript-libraries)  

-explore [wordpress](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/)

You enter the Drift Tavern.

The first character to approach you is a shady-looking man named "Scout." He offers to give you a healing potion in exchange for information.

IN GAME: Talk to at least six patrons and find out something about them. The first person [Keebo](keebo.md) talk's to is the noble.

Out of Game: Start with this .md file or your index page, and link to at least five other pages.

The second person is Chef Hellen and her soggy bread [Chef Hellen](Chef Hellen.md)
